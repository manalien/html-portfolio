    <h1>The Best Movies According to Joyce</h1>

    <h2>My top 4 movies of all-time.</h2>

    <hr />
    <h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
    <p>
        This is probably my favorite movie...you just need to watch this
    </p>

    <h3>Taxi Driver</h3>
    <p>
        I can't really rank these movies but taxi driver is the one that makes me think the most.
        Sometimes I just find myself looking back at this film and i love it whole heartedly, even though
        I can't claim to really understand it.
    </p>

    <h3>Knives Out</h3>
    <p>
        I absolutely love mystery movies and this was the most recent one I watched and then I watched it two more times.
        I just love the story and the main character. 
    </p>

    <h3>And Then There Were None(1945)</h3>
    <p>
        I've already stated my love for mysteries and I adore this film based on one of my favorite books with a more 
        humorous tone. It's very charming and fun.
